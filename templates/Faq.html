        <h3>1. What is the Heat Index?</h3>
        <p>
            The Heat Index, also known as the "apparent temperature," is a measure of how hot it feels when relative 
            humidity is combined with the actual air temperature. It indicates the perceived temperature by humans, 
            which can be higher than the actual air temperature on humid days.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>2. Why is the Heat Index important?</h3>
        <p>
            The Heat Index helps people understand the risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and 
            heatstroke, during high-temperature and high-humidity conditions. It's a valuable tool for staying safe 
            during hot weather.
        </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>3. How is the Heat Index calculated?</h3>
        <p>
            The Heat Index is calculated using a mathematical formula that considers the air temperature and relative 
            humidity. While the exact formula is complex, it essentially reflects how moisture in the air affects 
            the body's ability to cool itself through sweating.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>4. What are the Heat Index categories?</h3>
        <p>
            The Heat Index is categorized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Caution:</b> Fatigue possible with prolonged exposure and physical activity.</li>
            <li><b>Extreme Caution:</b> Heat exhaustion or heat cramps possible with prolonged exposure.</li>
            <li><b>Danger:</b> Heat cramps or heat exhaustion likely; heatstroke possible with continued activity.</li>
            <li><b>Extreme Danger:</b> Heatstroke is imminent.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
